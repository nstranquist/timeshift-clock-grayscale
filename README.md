### "Shift Time in Your Favor!"
### Site Live [Here](https://timeshift-grayscale.surge.sh)
## Goal:
Create the raw layout without worrying too much about colors.  
Worked especially hard on making this layout "mobile-first".  
In future versions, I will add more to make this project feel better.  

## Future Goals:
Optimized JavaScript eventListeners,  
Minified CSS and Javascript,  
TimeShift Implementation,  
Working Alarm and Log Features,  
Aesthetic Color Scheme,  
Data Persistence, Database setup,  
User Logins, Save user data,
